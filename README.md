## To-do react/redux practice

This is pretty much my attempt to recreate the excellent code over at the [redux.js](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/Examples.html) tutorials. I'm referring back to them when I get stuck, as a paint-by-numbers sort of practice for me. I'd recommend starting there. They've got a lot of really valuable information, and their documentation is pretty good.
